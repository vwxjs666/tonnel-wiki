# Tonnel Private DNS  

Domain Names replace long random wallet addresses with easy readable ones.  

## Advantages of Tonnel DNS  

- Public wallet address (like regular TON DNS)  
- Private, untraceable transactions (via zk-protocol)  
- Lifetime ownership (no renewals)  
- Lower cost than standard TON DNS (20% change to get the DNS for free!)

## How to Buy  

1. Open [@Tonnel_Network_bot](https://t.me/Tonnel_Network_bot)  
2. Use the /menu command then select Private TON DNS.  
3. Search for your desired DNS name.  
  - Minimum length is 1 character.  
  - Price is based on length (paid in $TONNEL). (>13 characters = 1 $TONNEL)

  - Auction duration is 1 hour.
