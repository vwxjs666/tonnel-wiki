# Tonnel Gift Marketplace  

Before anything, make sure you are using [@Tonnel_Network_Bot](https://t.me/Tonnel_Network_Bot).  
Add [@GiftRelayer](https://t.me/GiftRelayer) to your contacts and send it a single message so the bot can send you gifts in the future (we recommend giving it a custom name and profile to avoid mistakes when sending gifts).

- Top-left you can see your current balance + deposit ( + ) and withdrawal ( – ) buttons.
