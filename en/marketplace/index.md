## Pre-Market

Gifts bought or upgraded using **Telegram Stars** can be refunded within 21 days.  
To prevent abuse, Telegram has applied a 21 day lock so you cannot transfer your gift after an upgrade or purchase from the Telegram Gift Market during this period.

**Pre-Market** allows users to safely sell or buy new gifts before the 21-day lock is over.

### Listing a Gift in Pre-Market

1. **Unhide the gift** from your profile.  
2. **Set a username** (if you don’t already have one).  
3. **Send the gift link** to **[@Tonnel_Network_Bot](https://t.me/Tonnel_Network_Bot)**.  
4. Go to **My Gifts → Unlisted Gifts**.  
   - You’ll see a **clock icon** next to the gift filters.  
   - Toggle it to see unlisted pre-market gifts you have.  

- To list a gift on Pre-Market, you must **lock 20% of your desired price as collateral**.  
- If you **don't send the gift** to **[@GiftRelayer](https://t.me/GiftRelayer)** within the 21-day window:  
  - You **lose your collateral**.  
  - The buyer receives their money back **plus half of your collateral**.
